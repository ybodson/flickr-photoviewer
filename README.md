# FlickrPhotoViewer

**Demo of a simple photo viewer using Flickr's public RSS feed**

This is an experiment to evaluate the difficulty of replicating the [QML photoviewer demo](http://doc.qt.digia.com/qt/demos-declarative-photoviewer.html) using collection views in iOS 6.

The original demo used a very neat QML feature called [Packages](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qml-qtquick2-package.html) that allowed to smoothly transition between layouts.
